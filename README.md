### 👋 Welcome, I'm Lucas
I'm curious, resolutive, and I'm always trying to learn something new.
I have passion for technology, music and languages.

I'm a full stack javascript developer, I've worked mainly with Angular and Node.js, but I'm currently learning about React.js and React Native.

Here you have a little bit about myself:
- ✍🏼 I like to write IT related posts ([Medium](https://lucasotano.medium.com/), [Dev.to](https://dev.to/lucasota))
- 🎸 I have been playing the guitar since I was 11 years old ([A song that I wrote along a couple friends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoPnVyxuAQY))
- 🗺️ I love languages and to travel (I speak spanish, english, german and a little bit of italian)
